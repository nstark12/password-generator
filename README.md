# Random Password Generator

## Description

This random password generator was created to allow anyone to randomly generate a password based on the criteria that they selected. The interface is responsive and adapts to mutliple screen sizes. This project gave me a much better understanding of how to utilize JavaScript.

## Usage

To use this password generator, select "Generate Password". A pop-up will deploy that asks you to choose a number of characters between 8 and 128. After you enter a valid number, you will be asked if you want to include special characters, uppercase characters, lowercase characters, and numerics. You can select "OK" to include or "Cancel" to not include each type. However, you must include at least one type to generate a password.

After you make your selections, a random password will be generated.
